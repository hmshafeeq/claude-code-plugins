# Work Plan Execution Command

Execute a work plan efficiently while maintaining quality and finishing features.

## Introduction

This command takes a work document (plan, specification, or todo file) and executes it systematically. The focus is on **shipping complete features** by understanding requirements quickly, following existing patterns, and maintaining quality throughout.

## Input Document

<input_document> #$ARGUMENTS </input_document>

## Execution Workflow

### Phase 1: Quick Start

1. **Read Plan and Clarify**

   - Read the work document completely
   - Review any references or links provided in the plan
   - If anything is unclear or ambiguous, ask clarifying questions now
   - Get user approval to proceed
   - **Do not skip this** - better to ask questions now than build the wrong thing

2. **Setup Environment**

   Choose your work style:

   **Option A: Live work on current branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout main && git pull origin main
   git checkout -b feature-branch-name
   ```

   **Option B: Parallel work with worktree (recommended for parallel development)**
   ```bash
   # Ask user first: "Work in parallel with worktree or on current branch?"
   # If worktree:
   skill: git-worktree
   ```

3. **Create Todo List**
   - Use TodoWrite to break plan into actionable tasks
   - Include dependencies between tasks
   - Prioritize based on what needs to be done first
   - Include testing and quality check tasks

### Phase 2: Execute

1. **Task Execution Loop**

   For each task in priority order:

   ```
   while (tasks remain):
     - Mark task as in_progress in TodoWrite
     - Read any referenced files from the plan
     - Look for similar patterns in codebase
     - Implement following existing conventions
     - Write tests for new functionality
     - Run tests after changes
     - Mark task as completed in TodoWrite
     - Mark off the corresponding checkbox in the plan file ([ ] -> [x])
   ```

   **IMPORTANT**: Always update the original plan document by checking off completed items.

2. **Follow Existing Patterns**

   - The plan should reference similar code - read those files first
   - Match naming conventions exactly
   - Reuse existing components where possible
   - Follow project coding standards (see CLAUDE.md)
   - When in doubt, grep for similar implementations

3. **Test Continuously**

   - Run relevant tests after each significant change
   - Don't wait until the end to test
   - Fix failures immediately
   - Add new tests for new functionality

4. **Track Progress**
   - Keep TodoWrite updated as you complete tasks
   - Note any blockers or unexpected discoveries
   - Create new tasks if scope expands

### Phase 3: Quality Check

1. **Run Core Quality Checks**

   Always run before submitting:

   ```bash
   # Run full test suite (use project-specific test command)
   npm test  # or: pytest, go test, bundle exec rspec, etc.

   # Run linting (per CLAUDE.md)
   npm run lint  # or project-specific linting command
   ```

2. **Consider Reviewer Agents** (Optional)

   Use for complex, risky, or large changes:

   - **code-quality-analyst**: Check for patterns, anti-patterns, and unnecessary complexity
   - **performance-oracle**: Check for performance issues
   - **security-sentinel**: Scan for security vulnerabilities
   - **architecture-strategist**: Verify architectural decisions

   Run reviewers in parallel with Task tool:

   ```
   Task(code-quality-analyst): "Review changes for patterns and simplicity"
   Task(security-sentinel): "Scan for security vulnerabilities"
   ```

3. **Final Validation**
   - All TodoWrite tasks marked completed
   - All tests pass
   - Linting passes
   - Code follows existing patterns

### Phase 4: Ship It

1. **Create Commit**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git status  # Review what's being committed
   git diff --staged  # Check the changes

   # Commit with conventional format
   git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
   feat(scope): description of what and why

   Brief explanation if needed.
   EOF
   )"
   ```

2. **Create Pull Request**

   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature-branch-name

   gh pr create --title "Feature: [Description]" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
   ## Summary
   - What was built
   - Why it was needed
   - Key decisions made

   ## Testing
   - Tests added/modified
   - Manual testing performed

   ## Screenshots
   [If UI changes, include before/after]
   EOF
   )"
   ```

3. **Notify User**
   - Summarize what was completed
   - Link to PR
   - Note any follow-up work needed

## Key Principles

### Start Fast, Execute Faster

- Get clarification once at the start, then execute
- Don't wait for perfect understanding - ask questions and move
- The goal is to **finish the feature**, not create perfect process

### The Plan is Your Guide

- Work documents should reference similar code and patterns
- Load those references and follow them
- Don't reinvent - match what exists

### Test As You Go

- Run tests after each change, not at the end
- Fix failures immediately
- Continuous testing prevents big surprises

### Quality is Built In

- Follow existing patterns
- Write tests for new code
- Run linting before pushing
- Use reviewer agents for complex/risky changes only

### Ship Complete Features

- Mark all tasks completed before moving on
- Don't leave features 80% done
- A finished feature that ships beats a perfect feature that doesn't

## Quality Checklist

Before creating PR, verify:

- [ ] All clarifying questions asked and answered
- [ ] All TodoWrite tasks marked completed
- [ ] Tests pass (run project test command)
- [ ] Linting passes (run project lint command)
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns
- [ ] Commit messages follow conventional format
- [ ] PR description includes summary and testing notes

## When to Use Reviewer Agents

**Don't use by default.** Use reviewer agents only when:

- Large refactor affecting many files (10+)
- Security-sensitive changes (authentication, permissions, data access)
- Performance-critical code paths
- Complex algorithms or business logic
- User explicitly requests thorough review

For most features: tests + linting + following patterns is sufficient.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Analysis paralysis** - Don't overthink, read the plan and execute
- **Skipping clarifying questions** - Ask now, not after building wrong thing
- **Ignoring plan references** - The plan has links for a reason
- **Testing at the end** - Test continuously or suffer later
- **Forgetting TodoWrite** - Track progress or lose track of what's done
- **80% done syndrome** - Finish the feature, don't move on early
- **Over-reviewing simple changes** - Save reviewer agents for complex work
