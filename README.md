# Claude Code Plugins

A Claude Code plugin marketplace featuring **Compound Engineering Essentials** — framework-agnostic tools that make each unit of engineering work easier than the last.

## Plugin

| Plugin | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `compound-engineering-essentials` | Framework-agnostic AI-powered development tools for any tech stack |

## Install

```bash
# Add marketplace
claude /plugin marketplace add https://github.com/hmshafeeq/claude-code-plugins

# Install plugin
claude /plugin install compound-engineering-essentials
```

## Workflow

```
Plan → Work → Review → Compound → Repeat
```

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/workflows:plan` | Turn feature ideas into detailed implementation plans |
| `/workflows:work` | Execute plans with worktrees and task tracking |
| `/workflows:review` | Multi-agent code review before merging |
| `/workflows:compound` | Document learnings to make future work easier |

Each cycle compounds: plans inform future plans, reviews catch more issues, patterns get documented.

## Philosophy

**Each unit of engineering work should make subsequent units easier—not harder.**

Traditional development accumulates technical debt. Every feature adds complexity. The codebase becomes harder to work with over time.

Compound engineering inverts this. 80% is in planning and review, 20% is in execution:
- Plan thoroughly before writing code
- Review to catch issues and capture learnings
- Codify knowledge so it's reusable
- Keep quality high so future changes are easy
